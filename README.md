# python-api-challenge

First, using weather API data, this project compares random city locations with their respective maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. It then finds the linear regression of latitude vs each category for both hemispheres. 


Second, using Geoapify, this project creates interactable maps plotting each randomly created city, with each icon's size representative of the city's humidity. The second interactable map also includes information to the nearest hotel within 10,000 meters of each city.
